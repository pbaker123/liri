Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

The famed liri will change your life! Read tweets, look up a song, look up a movie, liri does it all.  You might expect to pay $999.99 or a device that does similar, but here it is free my friends!

When you wish to read tweets, you can select between reading all the tweets at your home page, or just the tweets you have posted.

When you look up a song liri can either open the preview link in your default browser or copy the link to your clipboard.

If you don't know what you want to do, no worries.  Liri can guess what you want, and do it or you!

to run liri type: node liri.js
